/*
    Q0: take a time to inspect code and its comment, try to understand what every line does.
    Q1: complete TODOs
    Q2: notice that all scheduling methods are preemptive. explain how preemtion is achived in the code.
    Q3: test all schedulers by changing SCHEDULING_ALGORITHM variable in process.c, for each scheduler build & run (gcc *.c && ./a.out).
        The program will output detailed information. use this information to draw gantt charts (both for cpu and io).
