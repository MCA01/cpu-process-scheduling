# cpu-process-scheduling
CPU Process Scheduling Project With FCFS, SJFS and Priority Scheduler Algorithms in C Language.

It was an assignment for the Operating Systems lecture, and I implemented only SJF and Priority Scheduler algorithms.

To run this project, your machine must support any GCC Compiler.
